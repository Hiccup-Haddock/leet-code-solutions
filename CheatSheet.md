### Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements in an array and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted, with larger elements "bubbling" to the end.

#### Selection Sort

- Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the smallest element in an array and places it at the beginning. It continues this process for the remaining unsorted portion until the entire array is sorted.
